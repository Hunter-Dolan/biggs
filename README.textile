biggs is a small ruby tool to format postal addresses from over 60 countries. Use it as a standalone ruby gem or as a plugin for Rails.

h3. Install

As a ruby gem
   
   sudo gem install yolk-biggs
   
or as a Rails plugin:
   
   script/install plugin git://github.com/yolk/biggs.git

h3. Standalone usage
   
   f = Biggs::Formatter.new
   
   f.format(
      :recipient  => "Yolk Sebastian Munz & Julia Soergel GbR", 
      :street     => "Adalbertstr. 11",
      :city       => "Berlin",
      :zip        => 10999,
      :state      => "Berlin", # <= state/province/region
      :country    => "de" # <= ISO alpha 2 code
   )

returns
   
   "Yolk Sebastian Munz & Julia Soergel GbR
   Adalbertstr. 11
   10999 Berlin
   Germany"
   
At the moment Biggs::Formatter.new accepts only one option:

*blank_county_on* ISO alpha 2 code (single string or array) of countries the formatter should skip the line "country" (for national shipping).
   
   f = Biggs::Formatter.new(:blank_county_on => "de")
   
With the data from the above example this would return:

   "Yolk Sebastian Munz & Julia Soergel GbR
   Adalbertstr. 11
   10999 Berlin
   "

h3. Usage with Rails and ActiveRecord

   Address < ActiveRecord::Base
      biggs :postal_address
   end
   
This adds the method postal_address to your Address-model, and assumes the presence of the methods/columns recipient, street, city, zip, state, and country to get the address data. Country should return the ISO-code (e.g. 'us', 'fr', 'de'). 

You can customize the method-names biggs will use by passing in a hash of options:
   
   Address < ActiveRecord::Base
      biggs :postal_address, 
            :zip => :postal_code,
            :country => :country_code
   end
   
Now biggs will use the methods postal_code and country_code to gather the data for the ZIP-code and the country:

To access the formatted address string, simply call the provided method on an address instance:

   Address.find(1).postal_code
   
If you pass in a ISO alpha 2 code as :country that is not supported by biggs, it will choose the US-format for addresses with an state specified, and the french/german format for addresses without an state.
